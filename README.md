# MarioKart_Gestures_Animations
Overview
Tired of boring button-centric UI? Well...in iOS it's easy to implement interactive gestures and fun animations to give your UI some well deserved pop! In this lab you'll build an app that allows users to interact with characters from the iconic video game, Mario Kart, panning, scaling, rotating and then sending them zooming off the screen! 🏎

User Story Tiers
The user stories for this lab are split up into 3 tiers. Tier 1 stories will introduce the core concepts of working with gestures and animations. Your goal should be to get through Tier 1 stories during your in-class lab time.

After completing Tier 1 stories you'll be able to...

Use gestures to trigger events.
Use gestures to move and transform views.
Use animations to transition views between various positions and transformations.
